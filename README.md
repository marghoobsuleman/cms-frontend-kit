## 📦 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
npm install @hashtagcms/themes
```

### Basic Usage

**Import in your SCSS:**
```scss
@import "~@hashtagcms/themes/src/themes/basic/sass/app";
```

**Import in your JavaScript:**
```javascript
import '@hashtagcms/themes/src/themes/basic/js/app';
```

### Using Pre-compiled Assets

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@hashtagcms/themes/dist/themes/basic/app.css">
<script src="node_modules/@hashtagcms/themes/dist/themes/basic/app.js"></script>
```

### 💻 CLI Usage

You can interactive copy assets (fonts, images, vendor files) from a theme to your project using the CLI.

```bash
# Run the interactive setup
npx @hashtagcms/themes init
```

The CLI will ask you:
1. Which theme you want to install
2. Where to copy the assets (default: `./resources/assets/fe`)

The assets will be copied to `<destination>/<theme-name>/`.
